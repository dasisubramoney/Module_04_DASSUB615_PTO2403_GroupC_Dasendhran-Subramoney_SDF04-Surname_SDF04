Button 1: For button one I made it so that there is a gradient color change on the button itself. When you hover over the button the color changes and the scale of the button change to appear bigger when the cursor is hovering on the button.

Button 2: For button two there is a background color on the button and when you hover over the button with the cursor then an animation will begin when the gradient of the color will change. The gradient will then continue changing back and forth for as long as the cursor is hovering over the button 

Button3: For button three this a gradient color background added. When the cursor is hovering on the button, the button moves side to side at 5px. The gradient also changes when the cursor is hovering on the button.
